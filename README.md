We expect this section for every plugin. It just explains how to use your plugin.
Never should a plugin rely on a 3rd party link to explain its behavior or functionality. We need this to ensure that if a website is removed or becomes inaccessible, people can still enjoy your plugins' functionality.

It often includes code snippets, which are just indented pieces of text:

	var script = new MyScript()
	script.doSomething();

Syntax highlighting will be done automatically for you.
